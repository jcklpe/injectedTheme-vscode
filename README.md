It's fun to say code injection. Sounds hackery. But it's really just using [[this neato extension]](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css) to put some extra css into vscode.

This is a repo for my current custom theme injections, AND it can serve as a nice project fork to make your own. Using gulp to generate the file because don't need anything more complicated.

Just run "gulp css" to compile the scss into css. Run "gulp watch" to watch the folder for changes.
